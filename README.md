# Hextree Android Path - Reverse Engineering and Security

This repository contains my notes and solutions from the **Hextree Android Path** series. The course covers essential topics for Android reverse engineering and security, including techniques for analyzing Android applications, identifying vulnerabilities, and exploiting various components. Below is a summary of the key topics I covered:

## Courses Completed:


### 1. **Android (Insecure) Storage**
   - Covered internal and external storage, vulnerabilities related to storage, and changes in recent Android versions.
   - Explored a storage-related vulnerability in a real Android application.

### 2. **Network Interception**
   - Explored networking interception techniques, including SSL interception.
   - Examined advanced techniques like abusing Android VPN features.

### 3. **Broadcast Receivers**
   - Focused on Androidâ€™s broadcast receivers and their role in system events and background tasks.
   - Covered how exported broadcast receivers can present security risks.

### 4. **WebViews and CustomTabs**
   - Covered the security implications of Android WebViews, which expose web threats alongside the Android runtime.
   - Discussed modern web integration features like CustomTabs and TrustedWebActivities.

### 5. **Dynamic Instrumentation**
   - Introduced **Frida**, a dynamic instrumentation toolkit for runtime exploration and application patching.

### 6. **Android Permissions**
   - Explored Androidâ€™s permission system, including how permissions are created and protected, and how they can be used to secure exported components.

### 7. **Android Services**
   - Discussed various types of Android services, including background services, Message Handler services, and AIDL services.
   - Taught how to recognize and analyze them during reverse engineering.

### 8. **Content- and FileProvider**
   - Focused on how Android apps share data and files securely using ContentProviders and FileProviders.
   - Discussed potential attack vectors and pitfalls in developer implementations.

### 9. **Intent Attack Surface**
   - Covered Android Intent communication and the security risks associated with Implicit Intent Hijacking, Intent Redirection, and Deeplinks.

### 10. **Reverse Engineering Android Apps**
   - Introduced the fundamentals of reverse-engineering Android applications.
   - Covered tools and techniques for fetching APKs, decompiling them, and understanding the internals of Android apps.
